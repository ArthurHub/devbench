// Pose: places the HMD and both controllers without calibrating. The game puts a Wand
// straight at its controller's pose, so a world point maps to tracking space through the
// HMD alone: world = hmdWorld + turn(theta) * unitsPerMeter * game(tracking - hmdTracking),
// where game() swaps OpenVR's axes (x right, y up, -z forward) into the world's (x right,
// y forward, z up) and theta, the turn between tracking space and the world, is fitted from
// where the held Wands land. The head stays at one eye position and only turns (pitch and
// yaw), so the HMD node does not move between placements.
