			"Synthetic VR input. action='capabilities' (default) returns the contract version, readiness, limits and "
			"supported actions; clients should check it rather than assume this tool exists. device='vrTrackedSet' "
			"(the only device on Fallout 4) replaces the HMD and both controllers at the OpenVR boundary. 'status' "
			"reports readiness, the active sequence and, per hooked OpenVR call, whether devbench sits closest to the "
			"runtime (when false, another mod hooked that call first and injected input bypasses it). 'observe' returns "
			"the current physical HMD and controllers as one frame. 'sequence' plays a prevalidated timestamped list of "
			"frames, each holding the HMD, left and right poses plus both controllers' OpenVR button/touch/axis state; it "
			"is asynchronous, has one owner, and returns a controlToken that 'stop' requires. A 'sequence' carrying the "
			"running sequence's controlToken replaces its frames in place, without handing the devices back to the "
			"physical controllers in between (same controller indices required). 'releaseAll' stops this "
			"owner's sequence. The real devices pass through whenever no sequence is active, and a sequence stops on "
			"load and new game. Emits input.vrTrackedSet events. "
			"action='press' (hand, buttons, durationMs default 100, delayMs) holds named buttons on one controller "
			"for durationMs on top of the active sequence or pose hold, as its owner (409 otherwise); trigger and grip also "
			"drive their analog axis to 1.0, and the controller packet number moves on at press start and end. It ends with "
			"the sequence. capabilities.vrTrackedSet.pressButtons lists the names. "
			"action='pose' places the HMD and controllers without calibrating and holds them: the game puts each wand "
			"(primaryWandNode / secondaryWandNode, mapped to physical left/right) straight at its controller, so a world "
			"point maps to tracking space through the HMD node and a turn fitted from where the held wands land. Skyrim's "
			"calibrated 'reach' is not on Fallout (400; use pose). The first pose takes over in the ready pose (head pitched -22 deg, hands 0.6 m "
			"in front at chest height, swung 10 deg left so the desktop mirror shows them), at the eye height that puts "
			"the camera head.cameraHeight units above the feet over the room node's lift (a body mod's seated / standing "
			"offset), so the body stands naturally. 'head' is 'ready' (pitch -22, yaw 0), 'down' (pitch -60, looking at "
			"the body) or {pitch?, yaw?, lookAt?, root?, eyeHeight?, cameraHeight?}: pitch (negative looks down) and yaw "
			"(positive turns left) in tracking degrees turn the head about the eyes; lookAt ('left' | 'right' | 'hands' | "
			"<node> with root? | [x,y,z]) computes them instead, aimed once, before anything moves, at a hand's target in "
			"this call (or its wand when the call leaves it), the hands' midpoint, a node or a world point (a hand target is "
			"aimed at again once the wands land, since the turn moves the body), and the hold keeps the angles; either height restarts the hold in the ready pose at that height. 'hands' is 'ready' (both) "
			"or {left?, right?} each 'ready', {node, root?, front?, offset?} (a node of the player: a VR node slot as the "
			"nodes tool names it, else that name in the first-person skeleton, else in the body; root 'player' or "
			"'firstPerson' searches one; front world units ahead along the facing, plus a world offset) or "
			"{world:[x,y,z]}, the last two with an optional "
			"controller pitch / yaw in degrees (the ready 10 / 10 otherwise; over 90 tilts it back past vertical); an absent hand stays. It "
			"moves over moveMs, corrects up to 'corrections' times while a wand is further than toleranceUnits from its "
			"target, holds holdMs (default 60 s), and answers once placed (about 0.5-1 s) with { controlToken, fresh, "
			"eyeHeight, headPitch, headYaw, lookAt? { target, clamped, reaimed? }, turnDeg (with a node or world target), "
			"corrections, hands { left, right: { tracking, pitch, yaw, wand, target?, error? } }, elapsedMs }. A later pose "
			"by the same owner moves from the held one in place (fresh: false); 'press' works over it; 'stop' with its "
			"controlToken hands the devices back. A pose while another sequence holds the devices, this owner's own "
			"included, answers 409. Fingers are not driven.";
